## Learning Git and Blogging on Gitub

Learning more about Github, added this blog to try out some markdown and Jekyll.
Mainly usinf VSC to build with, currently trying out Github CoPilot and using ChatGPT to organise my old coding projects. Have a lot of small projects to upload to github as only worked on them locally in the past.
