Created a new Repo today to practice with Flask and to deploy on Render.com
The repo is private but the Render link is https://flask-in-grey.onrender.com
Its a basic image manipulation script, but impliments some basic functions to see how they work.
I may keep using it for practice or just create new simple code ideas to see how they look on Render.
I like that it links to Github and any Git Pushes automatically update on the live working version on Render.
