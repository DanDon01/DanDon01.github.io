Been working on the Trilobot code last night using Cursor. 
Coding on my PC with Claude Sonnet 3.5 and using github to pull changes on to the Trilobots raspberry Pi4 'brain'.
It currently steams locally using an attched PiCamera and is controlled with a PS4 controller.
I've added a few fun functions for the lights when the Triangle, Cross and Square button are pressed.
The ultrasonic sensor no longer works as the Pi was updated and now uses PinCtrl for the GPIOs. Not sure if there is a fix for this.
